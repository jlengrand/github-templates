Adding premium content to your skill is a way for you to monetize your skill.  This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic ISP skill. It takes the hello world skill and adds greetings in a variety of languages as premium content. This premium content is accessed through a one-time purchase of the "Premium Greeting Pack". This guide walks through the setup of this skill, including the creation of the in-skill products.

## Skill Architecture
Each skill consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end.
1. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the voice interaction model.
2. The back end is where the logic of your skill resides.
